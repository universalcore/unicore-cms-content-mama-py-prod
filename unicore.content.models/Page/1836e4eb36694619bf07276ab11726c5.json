Your body is adapting, and growing a baby!\r\n\r\nYou can help your breathing by keeping away from dirty air and smoky places.\r\n\r\nDo you smoke? Stop, or cut down now. It is bad for health. Remember, you can save the money you spend on smoking to buy things you will need during pregnancy and for the baby.\r\n\r\nAsk your family to smoke outside.\r\n\r\nIf your house is smoky, open doors and windows. You can reduce smoke when you cook:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tUse a gas stove, if possible.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tUse a lid. The pot can conserve heat and you can reduce cooking time, and so breathe in less smoke.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tSoak food before cooking to reduce cooking time.\r\n\r\nIf you are breathless all the time, you may be anaemic. This means your body lacks iron. \r\n\r\nTaking iron tablets will help. You can also make sure you eat a variety of different foods like leafy vegetables, eggs, fruit and poultry. They all help your body to get iron.\r\n\r\n",
